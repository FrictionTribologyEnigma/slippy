A python package for tribologists


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://slippy.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

A python 3 module for tribologists. We aim to provide acess to open source 
versions of common models and solvers in tribology. We think this is important
both to push work forward by making cutting edge modelling tools avalible to 
experimentalists, and to contribute to reproducability of results. 

In making this code we have tried to keep the interface (the API) as simple and
intuative as possible while giving references that detail the exact working 
of the code and credit the original authors that made the code possible.

We have also tried to document the entire code and provide examples to get even
the most novice python user started. Minimal examples are avalible as part of 
the code, more detailed examples can be found in the examples folder of the 
repository.
